# Integrated Urgent Care Reference Datasets

This repo is a temporary repo to store useful reference data to support the NHS Integrated Urgent Care system.

## Datasets

### DoS Postcode Distance Mappings
This dataset maps postcodes to search distance, which can be passed as part of a search query to the Directory of Services. This allows search areas to be significantly reduced in areas of high density, as there are far more service results available in a smaller area.
